# Gas Leak Detection System

This repository contains the code for a Gas Leak Detection System designed to monitor and detect harmful gases such as methane (CHâ‚„), propane, or other combustible gases in the environment. The system alerts the user when the gas levels exceed a specified safety threshold.


## Overview

Gas leaks pose a significant risk to life and property. This project is built to detect dangerous gas levels and trigger an alert system, minimizing the chances of a fire or explosion. The core of this system uses gas sensors to monitor air quality, and when gas concentrations exceed safe levels, the system triggers an alert (e.g., LED, buzzer, or sending a signal).


## Features

- Real-time gas level monitoring
- Alerts: Visual and/or sound alerts when gas concentrations exceed safe levels.
- Customizable threshold: The threshold for gas concentration can be set based on the specific application.
- Scalable: Can be integrated with IoT platforms for remote monitoring.


## Components
This system requires the following hardware components:

1. Gas Sensor: MQ-2, MQ-3, or any other compatible gas sensor.
2. Microcontroller: Arduino, ESP8266, or similar.
3. Alert System: LEDs, buzzers, or external alarms.
4. Power Supply: Power for the microcontroller.
5. Cables and breadboard: For connecting components.

## Software Requirements
Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE to upload the code to the microcontroller.
